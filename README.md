# Git-tastic Beat Factory

## A funky rhythm game (currently Webkit only)

###Background
GitHub users fork, push, pull, and clone everyday, but who makes sure those actions  reach their correct destination? On the back end of GitHub, a git bot sorts those  actions to the beat of his favorite tunes. Under the supervision of Url the  unicorn, he must sort all the actions correctly, or Url will take his music away!  Help git bot sort the fork, push, pull, and clone actions as they travel through  the factory and down the conveyer belt, and watch as his actions corresspond to  what he is sorting!

###How to Play
Select start and choose a song. Press the F, G, H, and J keys on your keyboard as  the fork, push, pull, and clone symbols go down the conveyer to the beat of the  music. The better your timing, the higher your score will be!
